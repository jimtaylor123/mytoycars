# MY TOY CARS - a simple app for little boys to enjoy their cars

## Basic forms
1. Investigate more modular form input components...
1. Improve race city select - replace list with one that contains country and show country to user
2. Change colour in create car to colour select
3. Change some other input to select and/or multi select
4. Try and incorporate a time/date inht using some vue package
5.  Add preview of car when uploading a new image to replace an existing one
6. Check all crud forms 1. work for create/edit/delete 2. validate data properly 3. show validation errors properly

## General
4. Distinguish login from splash screen
5. Set up email

## Permissions etc. 
1. Use form requests for all back end validation - need to do this for car
2. Create base controller? 
3. Integrate laravel user/roles package?
4. Permissions for acting on races - should be admin only... 

## Race results
9.  Add race results as sub element to show race
10. Order cars in race result by drag and drop - admin permissions apply
11. Add race results under each race with option to drag and drop reorder for admin
12. Add a filterable/clickable list table underneath each car showing races

##  Devops
13. Fully package for devops using docker, free ssl, github actions, k8s (not swarm) and terraform... 
14. Deploy for free on heroku

##Â Polish
2.  Create event when new user subscribes to email me their details
3.  Integrate images from unsplash into race view page, eg shanghai for shanghai, using api call
4.  Incorporate a reports page with a number of charts with exportable .xls/csv/tsv/pdf formats.  
5.  Have seperate read and write databases ... 
6.  Try to add other laravel packages = telescope, horizon, socialite... go mad and try and add as much complexity as possible! 
7.  convert all icons to zondicon vue components
